## Problem 1: Regression On Dummy Variables
```{r, echo=FALSE}
s_ex06p01_data_path <- "https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/asmasss2024/data/asm_bw_flem.csv"
```

Use the dataset with the breeds assigned to every animal and find out the influence of the breed on the response variable `body weight`. The data is available from

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(s_ex06p01_data_path, "\n")
```

Start by fitting a linear model with `Breed` as the only factor in the model, hence ignore the independent variables such as `Breast Circumference`, `BCS` and `HEI`. 


### Tasks

* Read the data

```{webr-r}
# use read.table to read data

# show data read

```

* Fit a linear model including breed as a factor

```{webr-r}
# use lm() function to fit linear model

# use summary() function to show results

```
