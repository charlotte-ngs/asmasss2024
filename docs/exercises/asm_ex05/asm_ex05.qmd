```{r}
#| label: asm_ex05_p01_setup

## Problem 1: Linear Regression on Genomic Information
Use the genomic dataset given at `r s_ex5p01_geno_data_path` to fit a linear regression model of the given observation on the two genomic locations. Assume that both loci have a purely linear effect on the observation. 


### Tasks

* Read the data from `r s_ex5p01_geno_data_path`

```{webr-r}
# read data

```


* Count number of favorable alleles $G_1$ and $H_1$

```{webr-r}
# counting number of favorable alleles

```

* Fit regression of observation on count of favorable alleles

```{webr-r}
# fit linear model of observation on allele counts

```
