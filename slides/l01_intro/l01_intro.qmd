## This Course

- Use dataset that is used to predict genomic breeding values and introduce four methods

1. Fixed Linear Effects Models - Least Squares
2. GBLUP - genomic version of BLUP
3. LASSO - still fixed linear effects model, but modified parameter estimation
4. Bayesian approach to estimate unknown parameter


## Significance

- Why is this important? 
- Is this only relevant for animal breeding? 
- What about the rest of animal science?

- General trend of collecting data has led to development of `Big Data`
- Examples
    + Politics: Elections, such as presidential campains in the US
    + Health care
    + Face recognition: https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/automatische-gesichtserkennung-so-einfach-ist-es-eine-ueberwachungsmaschine-zu-bauen
    + Artificial Inteligence (AI): Google, ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com), Wolfram Alpha (https://www.wolframalpha.com)
    + Agriculture: Precision Farming
    + Animal Science: Precision Livestock Farming



## Face Recognition

```{r}
#| label: facerecog
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
#| hook_convert_odg: true
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/facerecog.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/facerecog.png")
```


## Smart Farming

- Automated Milking Systems (AMS): Collection of data
- Sensor systems: SESAM
- CFIT: automated gathering of feed intake data


## SESAM

```{r farm-infrastrucutre, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='12cm'}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/farm-infrastrucutre.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/farm-infrastrucutre.png")
```


## CFIT

Use video image analysis based on time of flight (TOF) approach for 

- cow identification
- collection of feed intake data

See: https://youtu.be/XDC-C33HpEw?si=4da_MCjxf6gx9d2A

## Cow Identification

```{r cow-iden-tof, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="100%"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/cow-iden-tof.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/cow-iden-tof.png")
```


## Traditional Animal Breeding

- Before 2006
- Data collected for other purposes were used to predict breeding values
- Predicted breeding values as side-product


## Data Logistics

```{r datalogistics, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/datalogistics.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/datalogistics.png")
```

 
## Genomic Selection

- Same goal as in traditional breeding: Find animals with best genetic potential as parents of next generation
- New: use additional source of information
- __Genomic__ information
    + spread accross whole genome
    + single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
- Introduction: 

\small "> Meuwissen THE, Hayes BJ, Goddard ME (2001) Prediction of total genetic value
using genome-wide dense marker maps. Genetics 157:1819–1829"

- Popularisation:

\small "> L. R. Schaeffer. Strategy for applying genome-wide selection in dairy cat- tle. Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics, 123(4):218–223, 2006. ISSN 09312668. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0388.2006.00595.x."


## SNP

```{r snparchitecture, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/snparchitecture.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/snparchitecture.png")
```
 

## QTL

```{r linkagesnpqtl, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/linkagesnpqtl.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/linkagesnpqtl.png")
```
 

## Linkage

- Flanking SNPs and QTL not independent passed on from parents to progeny
- Favorable QTL-allele linked with a given SNP-allele
- QTL is unknown, but use SNPs close to QTL as information for selection


## Monogenic Model

- Assume quantitative trait is influenced by one locus only
- Locus is bi-allelic $\rightarrow$ two alleles ($G_1$ and $G_2$) and three genotypes
- Look at Distribution of trait values for three different genotypes


## Distribution No Effect

```{r monogenicmodeltraitdistributionnoeffect, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/monogenicmodeltraitdistributionnoeffect.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/monogenicmodeltraitdistributionnoeffect.png")
```


## Distribution With Effect

```{r monogenicmodeltraitdistribution, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/monogenicmodeltraitdistribution.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/monogenicmodeltraitdistribution.png")
```
  

## Breeding Value

- Definition: Two times deviation from large number of offspring from population mean
- Assume: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
- Compute population mean as expected value of genotypic values
- Compute expected genotypic value of offspring for each of the three parental genotypes
- Assume purely additive loci, hence $d = 0$


## Genomic Breeding Value

- Take into account many loci
- Approximate unknown QTL with linked SNP
- Estimate $a$-effects from monogenic model
- Compute genomic breeding values for all loci based on $a$ effects


## Two Approaches

1. Two Step Procedure (used currently in Swiss Dairy Cattle)
2. Single Step 


## Two Step

```{r twostepprocedure, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/twostepprocedure.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/twostepprocedure.png")
```


## Single Step

- Combine all information into one single BLUP-based analysis
- Problem: Determine covariance between animals with and without genomic information


## Summary: Traditional versus Genomic Selection

```{r summarytraditionalvsgs, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='11cm'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/summarytraditionalvsgs.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/summarytraditionalvsgs.png")
```
