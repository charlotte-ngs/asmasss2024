## Administration

- Course: 2 hours of lecture (2 V)
- Plan: 2 V $\rightarrow$ 1 U + 1 V (i.e., 1 hour of lecture intersperced with time to do exercises) 
- Exercises: Work on problems in R 
- Material: course notes, slides, solution to exercises
- Exam: written, date: 22.05.2023, 08:15-10:00 


## Objectives

The students 

- are familiar with the properties of __fixed linear effects models__
- are able to analyse simple data sets
- know why least squares cannot be used for genomic selection. 
- know the statistical methods used in genomic selection, such as 
    + BLUP-based approaches, 
    + Bayesian procedures and 
    + LASSO. 
- are able to solve simple exercise problems using the statistical framework R.

## This Course

- Use dataset that is used to predict genomic breeding values and introduce four methods

1. Fixed Linear Effects Models - Least Squares
2. GBLUP - genomic version of BLUP
3. LASSO - still fixed linear effects model, but modified parameter estimation
4. Bayesian approach to estimate unknown parameter


## Significance

- Why is this important? 
- Is this only relevant for animal breeding? 
- What about the rest of animal science?

- General trend of collecting data has led to development of `Big Data`
- Examples
    + Politics: Elections, such as presidential campains in the US
    + Health care
    + Face recognition
    + ChatGPT, AI in general
    + Agriculture: Precision Farming
    + Animal Science: Precision Livestock Farming



## Face Recognition

```{r facerecog, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width='12cm'}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/facerecog.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/facerecog.png")
```

## Smart Farming

- Automated Milking Systems (AMS): Collection of data
- Sensor systems: SESAM
- CFIT: automated gathering of feed intake data
